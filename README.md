# node-red-ai-toolkit

a collection of Node-RED nodes and flows for interactive low-code development of
applications using AI technologies - free of charge and even for beginners or 
casual programmers

## Overview ##

From Wikipedia: "Node-RED is a flow-based, low-code development tool for visual programming developed ... for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services" (nota bene: just as "hardware devices" are not required, the creation of "online services" is not mandatory)

Based on Node-RED, the "node-red-ai-toolkit" is a collection of Node-RED nodes and flows that help building AI-based applications: just

* import the appropriate nodes and flows into a Node-RED workspace,
* configure them according to your needs,
* wire them together to form your application,

and you are done!

### Its Part of an Ecosystem ###

Since real-world applications need more than just a few AI functions, the nodes from this toolkit fit seemlessly into a complete eco-system of further nodes, such as

* [node-red-http-endpoint-examples](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-http-endpoint-examples) - use these to learn how to create service "endpoints" which can be reached, e.g., over the internet
* [node-red-authorization-examples](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-authorization-examples) - often, you want your users to authenticate themselves - these examples show you how to achieve this
* [node-red-web-server-examples](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-web-server-examples) - most often, your AI services go along with a web-server which serves associated web pages, input forms or just files. If you do not want to install a separate web server, you may just import one of these examples to add an open or closed web server
* [node-red-contact-form-examples](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-contact-form-examples) - two examples for (GDPR-compliant) contact forms (for arbitrary users) and feedback forms (for authenticated users)
* [node-red-flow-brave](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-flow-brave), [node-red-flow-startpage](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-flow-startpage) - flows which allow you to run internet searches and parse their findings

### Deployment - Shipping for Users ###

And, if you plan to publish your application for other people to use it, you may be interested in

* [node-red-on-always-free-vm](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-on-always-free-vm), a set of instructions how to install a Node-RED server on an Oracle "Always-Free" VM (a program that gives you two small machines reachable from the internet all around the clock (24/7) for free, without ads or other nag-ware)
