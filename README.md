# node-red-ai-toolkit

a collection of Node-RED nodes and flows for interactive low-code development of
applications using AI technologies - free of charge and even for beginners or 
casual programmers

## Overview ##

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node-RED): "_Node-RED is a flow-based, low-code development tool for visual programming developed [...] for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services_" (nota bene: just as "hardware devices" are not required, the creation of "online services" is also not mandatory, Node-RED is pretty universal)

Based on Node-RED, the "node-red-ai-toolkit" is a collection of Node-RED nodes and flows that help building AI-based applications: just

* import the appropriate nodes and flows into a Node-RED workspace,
* configure them according to your needs,
* wire them together to form your application,

and you are done!

### It's Part of a free Ecosystem ###

Since real-world applications need more than just a few AI functions, the nodes from this toolkit fit seemlessly into a complete eco-system of further nodes, such as

* [node-red-http-endpoint-examples](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-http-endpoint-examples) - use these to learn how to create service "endpoints" which can be reached, e.g., over the internet
* [node-red-authorization-examples](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-authorization-examples) - often, you want your users to authenticate themselves - these examples show you how to achieve this
* [node-red-rest-service-examples](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-rest-service-examples) - if you do not need a full-blown database, one of the "key-value-stores" from these examples may already be sufficient. And, if you plan to manage (i.e., upload, modify, delete) the files on your server from remote, the file management nodes from this repo may get you going
* [node-red-web-server-examples](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-web-server-examples) - most often, your AI services go along with a web-server which serves associated web pages, input forms or just files. If you do not want to install a separate web server, you may just import one of these examples to add an open or closed web server
* [node-red-user-management-example](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-user-management-example) - managing users is hard, especially, if you have to keep **everything GDPR-compliant**. This set of nodes gives you everything you need, from user registration over email confirmation, user detail management, password reset up to the complete deletion of a user (if he/she wants so)
* [node-red-contact-form-examples](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-contact-form-examples) - two examples for (GDPR-compliant) contact forms (for arbitrary users) and feedback forms (for authenticated users)
* [node-red-flow-brave](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-flow-brave), [node-red-flow-startpage](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-flow-startpage) - flows which allow you to run internet searches and parse their findings

### Deploy it on the Internet - for free ###

And, if you plan to publish your application for other people to use it, you may be interested in

* [node-red-on-always-free-vm](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-on-always-free-vm), a set of instructions how to install a Node-RED server on an Oracle "Always-Free" VM (a program that gives you two small machines reachable from the internet all around the clock (24/7) for free, without ads or other nag-ware)

For deployment, you may replace the web server from one of the above examples by another one based on Node.js with Express (which still allows you to modify its behaviour without too much effort). in that case, you may consider

* [node-red-within-express](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-within-express) - an HTTP(S) server with embedded Node-RED instance
