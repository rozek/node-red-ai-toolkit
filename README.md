# node-red-ai-toolkit

a collection of Node-RED nodes and flows for interactive low-code development of
applications using AI technologies - free of charge and even for beginners or 
casual programmers

## Overview ##

From Wikipedia: "Node-RED is a flow-based, low-code development tool for visual programming developed ... for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services" (nota bene: just as "hardware devices" are not required, the creation of "online services" is not mandatory)

"node-red-ai-toolkit" is a collection of Node-RED nodes and flows that help building AI-based applications: just

* import the appropriate nodes and flows into a Node-RED workspace,
* configure them according to your needs,
* wire them together to form your application,

and you are done!

Since real-world applications need more than just a few AI functions, the nodes from this toolkit fit seemlessly into an eco-system of further nodes, such as

* xxx
* [node-red-flow-brave](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-flow-brave), [node-red-flow-startpage](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-flow-startpage) - flows which allow you to run internet searches and parse their findings

And, if you plan to publish your application for other people to use it, you may be interested in

* [node-red-on-always-free-vm](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-on-always-free-vm), a set of instructions how to install a Node-RED server on an Oracle "Always-Free" VM (a program that gives you two small machines reachable from the internet all around the clock (24/7) for free, without ads or other nag-ware)
